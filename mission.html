                                    Our mission at Post 206 is to build a veteran community in the Seattle area that contributes
                                    to the overall good of our neighbors and friends; cultivating good will and pride in our
                                    common identity as Americans.
                                </p>

                                <h1>Values</h1>
                                <p>Post 206 uses the following core values as guiding principles in all that we do:</p>
                                <div class="col-sm-6">
                                    <img src="img/inclusive.jpg" alt="Inclusivity">
                                    <h3>Inclusivity</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        Creating an inclusive community that welcomes veterans from all walks of
                                        life. Our post believes that a veteran is a veteran but celebrates the
                                        diversity of its membership. All veterans have a home in Post 206, no matter
                                        their race, religion, sexual orientation, age, disability, or gender
                                        identification.

                                    <p>
                                        Through service, our post and its membership grow as one by dedicating
                                        themselves to the betterment of the post, the community, and the individuals
                                        that make them up. We believe that service is how we remain engaged and
                                        committed to the community that we reside in. Veterans felt the call to serve
                                        once which is why we provide positive outlets for veterans to continue that
                                        call to service in their post military careers.

                                        As a post, we recognize that the veteran community has a set of complex and,
                                        often, misunderstood needs. Historically, veterans have not always had access
                                        to the information that they need in order to reintegrate to the civilian
                                        world. At Post 206 we dedicate ourselves to providing information, access
                                        to services, and the advocacy that veterans need to successfully transition
                                        from military service to civilian life, no matter how long ago they began
                                        this process.

                                        Though what we do as a post is service oriented and calls for a great deal
                                        of time and effort, we pride ourselves on making these service opportunities
                                        fun and enriching for all who partake. Through community building and
                                        restoration activities, we provide the space for veterans to grow together,
                                        and learn more about each other. Our services and programs aim to bridge
                                        existing gaps in our understanding of each other and foster an environment
                                        of friendship and camaraderie.

                                    change and setting the bar for all veteran service organizations.
